# Python-Projects(Stock-Share Analysis)
A company's stock share is a piece of the company; more precisely:

A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This
entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." [1]

An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases,
the investor with incur a loss.  Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. People trade stocks throughout the day. The stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges. In this lab, you will use the  y-finance API to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock. You will then be asked questions about your results. 
Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library
In this lab, I will use a Python library to obtain financial data. You will extract historical stock data using yfinance. A graded quiz will follow to test you on the results in the lab.

To complete this lab I will utilize JupyterLab running on the Cloud in Skills Network Labs environment. To launch the lab notebook in a new browser tab check the box below and click on the Open Tool button.
