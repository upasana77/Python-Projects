projec1: WebScraping of NBA datawe're going to complete the first part of a longer machine learning project on NBA Stats. NBA stands for National Basketball Association (based in North America). It's one of the largest men's professional basketball leagues in the world.

The final goal of the project is to predict who is going to win the MVP (Most Valuable Player) award in a given season. However, in this initial part, we're going to focus on gathering and preparing the data by scraping the necessary data on the NBA players and their statistics. We'll scrape multiple types of data and load them into pandas for easier analysis.
